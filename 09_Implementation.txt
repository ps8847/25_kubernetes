we will create aa folder named "Kube-mern" or whatever you like  

first we will make "Secrets" ->  there are alott of ways of adding secrets to our project we can follow offical documentation  

1) we will create file named  secret.yaml or wehatever name.yaml with following stuff 

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
        name: mongo-secret
    type: Opaque
    data:
        USER_NAME : bW9uZ291c2Vy (it should be base64 hased value not plain text)                             -> variable-name : base64 hashed value
        PASSWORD : bW9uZ29wYXNzd29yZA==      (it should be base64 hased value not plain text)                             -> variable-name : base64 hashed value


2) if we have a dtaabase in our application we will be needed a configuration file .. so for that we need to create file named same as upper like : mongo-config.yaml and will follow the following stuff

    apiVersion: v1
    kind:   ConfigMap
    metadata:
        name: mongo-config
    data:
        mongo-url : # will be added later 

3) Deployement -> ( get about this from documentation ) we will now deploy mongodb ... its really simple and easy ..  we wil create file nbamed weith .yaml as below  ( mongo-app.yaml )
        we will be providing the deployement information and environment variables 

        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: Deployment
        metadata:
        name: mongo-deployment
        labels:
            app: mongo
        spec:
        replicas: 1
        selector:
            matchLabels:
            app: mongo
        template:
            metadata:
            labels:
                app: mongo
            spec:
            containers:
            - name: mongo
                image: mongo:6.0
                ports:
                - containerPort: 27017
                env:
                - name: MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME
                valueFrom:
                    secretKeyRef:
                    name: mongo-secret
                    key: mongo-user
                - name: MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD
                valueFrom:
                    secretKeyRef:
                    name: mongo-secret
                    key: mongo-password

4) SERVICE  -> NOW WE WIL BE providing service to our pod (  service :  an abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service . with kubernetes you don't need to modify your application to use an unfamilier service discovery mechanism. kubernetes gives pods theri own ip addresses abnda a single DNS name for a set of Pods and can load-balance across them.)

        it willl look like this :

        in the same file we used for deployement configuration we can add below thing after --- 
        
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        metadata:
        name: mongo-service
        spec:
        selector:
            app: mongo
        ports:
            - protocol: TCP
            port: 27017
            targetPort: 27017


    Note : in that mongo-config.yaml file we left it with this -> 

            data:
        mongo-url : # will be added later 


        now we will rpelcae it with 
            data:
        mongo-url : mongo-service



5) we will do it all same for web-app.yaml also :

        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: Deployment
        metadata:
        name: webapp-deployment
        labels:
            app: webapp
        spec:
        replicas: 1
        selector:
            matchLabels:
            app: webapp
        template:
            metadata:
            labels:
                app: webapp
            spec:
            containers:
            - name: mongo-express
                image: mongo-express:latest
                ports:
                - containerPort: 8081
                env:
                - name: ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME
                valueFrom:
                    secretKeyRef:
                    name: mongo-secret
                    key: mongo-user
                - name: ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD
                valueFrom:
                    secretKeyRef:
                    name: mongo-secret
                    key: mongo-password
                - name: ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER
                valueFrom:
                    configMapKeyRef:
                    name: mongo-config
                    key: mongo-url

        ---

        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        metadata:
        name: webapp-service
        spec:
        type: NodePort
        selector:
            app: webapp
        ports:
            - protocol: TCP
            port: 8081
            targetPort: 8081
            nodePort: 30200


6) Nodeport : we will implement nodeport in web-app.yaml at service configuration . nodeprot is a fucntionality which will provide the way to connect to the ouside world by exposing the entry port for our application as port 

    
7) now just go to cmd and type >> minikube start

thats it

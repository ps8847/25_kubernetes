here we will get the knowledge of how to just only intereact with Mastwr Node and it will do oits work automactially 


1) we have kubeCTL which helps us to interact with the Master node ( master mind of k8s)  and furtehr interact with worker nodes
2) we can implements "Config" and "Secrets" as global things to make it accessible to worker nodes 
3) our worker node will be consist of "deployement" and "service" kind of things and to interact with the outer world it will has "NodePort" kind of thing
